# Rotation and translation combined
A rod free to move gets hit by a bullet at its extreme. The impact is anelastic and the system starts to rotate and translate at the same time. Here you can find the physics behind it and a python program that illustrates what happens.

The center of mass of the system rod-bullet can be identified as the point where the color changes from yellow to blue.

# Requirements
- python3 
- pygame library
